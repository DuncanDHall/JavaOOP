# JavaOOP
Supporting code for the OOP in Java independent study

I ended up not doing the JOOP exercises during the Fall 2016 semester, opting to do everything over winter break, as my goal is to prep for an algorithems class in Java in the Spring, not get more academic credit.

`JOOP_DEA/` is where I'm doing all of the work now. The other folders are remnants from the fall semester (and can be ignored).
